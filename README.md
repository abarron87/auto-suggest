# auto-suggest
This tool turns a nested tree of categories into an auto-suggest search. I have built this in 3 ways: using my own structure, using Backbone.js, and using AngularJS.

# how to use the demo

 - Start typing a superhero's name e.g. Green Lantern.
 - Choose from the list of suggestions.
 - Selection will disappear from suggestions and be added, along with ancestors, to the selected superheroes list.
